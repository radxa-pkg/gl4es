gl4es (1.1.4-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Jia Yuan Lo ]
  * Replace ifndef ANDROID with ifndef NOX11 for X11

  [ ptitSeb ]
  * Fixed issue with glXChooseFBConfig/glXChooseVisual

  [ Alex ]
  * add Tinker Board 1/1S compilation steps

  [ ptitSeb ]
  * Fixed an issue with LOGSHADERERROR on old program
  * [GLES2] Some small fixes to ARB old program handling
  * [GLX] smll change, again, to gl4es_glXGetVisualFromFBConfig (help CMR)

  [ JohnnyonFlame ]
  * Added GOA_CLONE definitions. Sets compilation definitions for GO Advance
    clones, such as the RG351p/v, Gameforce Chi, RGB10 and other such devices.
  * Add glX function stubs to be used with NOX11 targets. Can be enabled with
    GLX_STUBS, Works around Shovel Knight assert failures during startup.
  * Fix bit rot on EGL wrappers.
  * Added eglGetPlatformDisplay wrappers.
  * Include string.h on egl/lookup.c (for strcmp).
  * Fix backslash newline shader failures.
  * Added fbo resolution hack. The envvar LIBGL_FB_TEX_SCALE controls the scale
    of the framebuffer textures.
  * Added texture copy skip hack. The envvar LIBGL_SKIPTEXCOPIES controls
    whether or not to skip texture copies are skipped.
  * Skip Iconoclasts hotspot shaders for performance reasons.

  [ ptitSeb ]

  * [GLES2] Small change in shader logs
  * Prepare for adding glVertexAttribIPointer later
  * [GLES2] Fixed internal transpose functions (for #346)
  * Added GL_UNSIGNED_INT to target for pixel_convert, and fixed
    GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT for target (for #366)
  * Fixed issue when mixing VAO and glBegin/glEnd (should help #373, maybe #358,
    probably other too)

  [ Le Philousophe ]
  * Unbind framebuffer, if it is bound, before freeing it
  * Don't upgrade depth to GL_UNSIGNED_INT when GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT is given

  [ ptitSeb ]
  * Fixed a nasty bug in listdraw.c (thanks @artDev)
  * Put back a line removed by mystake in previous commit

  [ Alibek Omarov ]
  * arbparser: add brackets to case blocks where variables are declared, to
    prevent warnings spam on GCC
  * arbparser: close curly braces before break

  * Fixed some issue with some glFog parameter not correctly handled
    (GL_FOG_MODE, GL_FOG_COORD_SRC and GL_FOG_DISTANCE_MODE_NV)

  [ netpipe ]
  * cbpfile

  [ ptitSeb ]
  * Added an option on PYRA to limit FPS to 60
  * Fixed a potential issue when adjusting fbo-attached texture (fix regression

  * Add GL_R to pixel_sizeof macro (for #395)
